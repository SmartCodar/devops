# Setting Up Git Environment on Windows via Command Line

This Article will guide you through setting up a Git environment on a Windows system using the command line. It covers the essential steps required to install Git, configure SSH keys, clone repositories, manage branches, and more.

## Prerequisites

- A Windows operating system.
- Administrator access to install software.
- Basic knowledge of the command line.

## 1. Installing Git on Windows

Before you can start using Git, you need to install it on your Windows system.

### Step 1: Download Git

- Visit the official [Git website](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
- Download the latest version of Git for Windows. This will provide you with Git Bash, a command-line tool that offers a Unix-like interface for Git.

### Step 2: Install Git

- Run the downloaded installer. Follow the installation prompts carefully. Here are some key options to consider:
  - **Adjusting your PATH environment**: Select "Use Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" to ensure Git is available in all command-line interfaces.
  - **Configuring the line-ending conversions**: Choose "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" to handle line endings in a way that works well across different operating systems.

After the installation is complete, you should be able to use Git in the command line.

### Step 3: Verify the Installation

To verify that Git has been installed correctly, open Command Prompt or Git Bash and run:

```bash
git --version
```

This command should display the installed version of Git, confirming that the installation was successful.

## 2. Configuring Git

Once Git is installed, you need to configure it with your user information. This ensures that all your commits are properly attributed.

### Step 1: Set Your Username

Set your Git username with the following command:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

Replace `"Your Name"` with your actual name. This name will be associated with your commits and visible in the commit history.

### Step 2: Set Your Email

Set your email address, which will also be associated with your commits:

```bash
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Replace `"your.email@example.com"` with your actual email address. 

### Step 3: Verify Configuration

To ensure that your configurations are set correctly, run:

```bash
git config --list
```

This command displays all the settings currently configured in Git, including your username and email.

## 3. Generating and Configuring SSH Keys

SSH keys are crucial for securely connecting to remote Git repositories, such as those on GitHub or GitLab.

### Step 1: Generate an SSH Key

To generate a new SSH key, run:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email@example.com"
```

This command generates a 4096-bit RSA key pair, which is highly secure. When prompted, press Enter to accept the default file location.

### Step 2: Add SSH Key to the SSH Agent

Start the SSH agent in the background and add your newly created SSH key:

```bash
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

These commands ensure that your SSH key is available for Git operations.

### Step 3: Add SSH Key to GitHub/GitLab

To connect to GitHub or GitLab, you need to add your SSH key to your account.

#### Method 1: Using the `clip` Command

The `clip` command is used to copy the SSH key to your clipboard. This command is included by default in Windows 10 and later. To copy your SSH key:

```bash
clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

#### Method 2: Manual Copying (Alternative)

If `clip` is not available, you can manually copy the SSH key:

1. Open the SSH key file in a text editor:

    ```bash
    notepad ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```

2. Copy the contents manually.

- After copying, go to your GitHub/GitLab account settings, navigate to "SSH and GPG keys," and add a new SSH key by pasting the copied key.

### Step 4: Test SSH Connection

To verify that your SSH key is working, test the connection to GitHub:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should receive a success message indicating that your SSH key is correctly configured.

## 4. Cloning a Repository

Cloning a repository means downloading a copy of an existing Git repository to your local machine.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Use the following command to clone a repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
```

Replace `username/repository.git` with the actual repository's SSH path.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Repository

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to it using:

```bash
cd repository
```

Replace `repository` with the name of your cloned directory.

## 5. Working with Branches

Branches allow you to work on different features or versions of your project independently.

### Step 1: List All Branches

To list all branches, use:

```bash
git branch -a
```

This command shows both local and remote branches.

### Step 2: Create a New Branch

Create a new branch using:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

Replace `feature-branch` with your desired branch name. This command creates and switches to the new branch.

### Step 3: Switch Between Branches

To switch between branches, run:

```bash
git checkout main
```

Replace `main` with the name of the branch you want to switch to.

### Step 4: Push Branch to Remote

To push your branch to the remote repository, use:

```bash
git push -u origin feature-branch
```

This command uploads your branch to the remote repository and sets up tracking between the local and remote branches.

## 6. Making Changes and Committing

Once you've made changes to your files, you need to commit those changes to the repository.

### Step 1: Stage Changes

To stage individual files, use:

```bash
git add filename
```

To stage all changed files, use:

```bash
git add .
```

### Step 2: Commit Changes

Commit your staged changes with a message:

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

The commit message should briefly describe the changes made.

### Step 3: Push Changes to Remote

Finally, push your changes to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin feature-branch
```

Replace `feature-branch` with the branch you are working on.

## 7. Pulling Changes from Remote

To keep your local repository up to date with the remote repository, you need to pull the latest changes.

### Step 1: Pull Changes

Use the following command to pull changes:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

Replace `main` with the branch name you want to pull from.

## 8. Merging Branches

When you're done working on a feature branch, you may want to merge it back into the main branch.

### Step 1: Switch to Main Branch

Switch to the `main` branch with:

```bash
git checkout main
```

### Step 2: Merge Branch

Merge your feature branch into the main branch:

```bash
git merge feature-branch
```

Resolve any conflicts that arise during the merge.

### Step 3: Push Merged Changes

Push the merged changes to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin main
```

## 9. Viewing Commit History

To see a history of all commits in your repository, you can view the commit log.

### Step 1: View History

Use this command to view the commit history:

```bash
git log
```

For a more concise view, use:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

## 10. Tagging Commits

Tags are used to mark specific points in your commit history, often used to indicate versions or releases.

### Step 1: Create a Tag

Create a lightweight tag:

```bash
git tag v1.0
```

Or create an annotated tag with a message:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0"
```

### Step 2: Push Tags to Remote

Push all tags to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin --tags
```
