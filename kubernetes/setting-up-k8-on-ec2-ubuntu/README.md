# Setting Up an EC2 VM for Kubernetes: Installation and Tooling

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source platform designed for automating the deployment, scaling, and operation of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Key features include:

- Automated rollouts and rollbacks
- Service discovery and load balancing
- Storage orchestration
- Self-healing mechanisms
- Secret and configuration management

Kubernetes is essential for managing large-scale applications with multiple microservices, ensuring they run smoothly across a cluster of machines.

## Kubernetes vs. Docker

- **Scope**: Docker is a platform and tool for creating, deploying, and running containers. Kubernetes, on the other hand, is an orchestration system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts.
- **Complexity**: Docker is simpler and more straightforward for individual or small-scale applications. Kubernetes is more complex but powerful for managing large-scale applications with multiple microservices.
- **Scaling**: Docker Swarm (Docker's native orchestration tool) is suitable for simpler, less complex scaling needs. Kubernetes provides more sophisticated scaling and automation capabilities.
- **Ecosystem**: Kubernetes has a larger ecosystem with a wide range of tools and extensions. Docker focuses on the container runtime and less on orchestration.

## When to Use What

- **Use Docker**: When you need a straightforward solution for containerizing applications and running them on a single host or with minimal orchestration needs.
  - *Sample Use Case*: Deploying a simple web application in a development environment using Docker Compose to manage the multi-container setup.
  
- **Use Kubernetes**: When managing complex applications with multiple services, requiring robust orchestration, automated deployment, scaling, and management across clusters.
  - *Sample Use Case*: Running a microservices-based e-commerce platform that needs to scale seamlessly, manage services discovery, and ensure high availability across different geographical locations.

## Objective

This article focuses on setting up essential Kubernetes tools on an EC2 VM. Part one covers the installation of necessary tools, while part two will delve into cluster creation and service deployment.

## Tools and Libraries for Kubernetes Installation

The following shell script automates the installation of several essential tools for working with Kubernetes.

\`\`\`bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to install kubectl
install_kubectl() {
    echo "Installing kubectl..."
    curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
    chmod +x ./kubectl
    mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
    echo "kubectl installed successfully."
}

# Function to install kubens and kubectx
install_kubens() {
    echo "Installing kubens and kubectx..."
    git clone https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx.git ~/.kubectx
    sudo ln -s ~/.kubectx/kubectx /usr/local/bin/kubectx
    sudo ln -s ~/.kubectx/kubens /usr/local/bin/kubens
    echo "kubens and kubectx installed successfully."
}

# Function to install helm
install_helm() {
    echo "Installing Helm..."
    curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
    chmod 700 get_helm.sh
    ./get_helm.sh
    echo "Helm installed successfully."
}

# Function to install eksctl
install_eksctl() {
    echo "Installing eksctl..."
    curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
    sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin
    echo "eksctl installed successfully."
}

# Reinstall kubectl if it exists
if kubectl version --client; then
    echo "kubectl is already installed. Uninstalling..."
    sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/kubectl
    install_kubectl
else
    install_kubectl
fi

# Reinstall kubens if it exists
if [ -x "$(command -v kubens)" ]; then
    echo "kubens is already installed. Uninstalling..."
    sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/kubectx /usr/local/bin/kubens
    rm -rf ~/.kubectx
    install_kubens
else
    install_kubens
fi

# Reinstall Helm if it exists
if helm version; then
    echo "Helm is already installed. Uninstalling..."
    sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/helm
    install_helm
else
    install_helm
fi

# Reinstall eksctl if it exists
if eksctl version; then
    echo "eksctl is already installed. Uninstalling..."
    sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/eksctl
    install_eksctl
else
    install_eksctl
fi
\`\`\`

## Explanation of Methods in the Script

1. **\`install_kubectl\`**: This method installs \`kubectl\`, the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. It downloads the latest stable release of \`kubectl\`, makes it executable, and moves it to \`/usr/local/bin\`.
    \`\`\`bash
    install_kubectl() {
        echo "Installing kubectl..."
        curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
        chmod +x ./kubectl
        mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
        echo "kubectl installed successfully."
    }
    \`\`\`

2. **\`install_kubens\`**: This method installs \`kubens\` and \`kubectx\`, tools for managing Kubernetes contexts and namespaces. It clones the repository, creates symbolic links for the tools, and ensures they are accessible from \`/usr/local/bin\`.
    \`\`\`bash
    install_kubens() {
        echo "Installing kubens and kubectx..."
        git clone https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx.git ~/.kubectx
        sudo ln -s ~/.kubectx/kubectx /usr/local/bin/kubectx
        sudo ln -s ~/.kubectx/kubens /usr/local/bin/kubens
        echo "kubens and kubectx installed successfully."
    }
    \`\`\`

3. **\`install_helm\`**: This method installs Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes. It downloads the Helm installation script, makes it executable, and runs it to install Helm.
    \`\`\`bash
    install_helm() {
        echo "Installing Helm..."
        curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
        chmod 700 get_helm.sh
        ./get_helm.sh
        echo "Helm installed successfully."
    }
    \`\`\`

4. **\`install_eksctl\`**: This method installs \`eksctl\`, a CLI tool for managing AWS EKS clusters. It downloads the latest release, extracts it, and moves it to \`/usr/local/bin\`.
    \`\`\`bash
    install_eksctl() {
        echo "Installing eksctl..."
        curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
        sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin
        echo "eksctl installed successfully."
    }
    \`\`\`
